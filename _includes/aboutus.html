        <p>
            We are an organization of SMU students interested in the world of Game Design.
            We host Game Jams for SMU students to show off their design skills, offering mentorship and guidance in the process
            to help participants carry out their creative visions. Focusing on
            art, programming, and game design techniques, the SMU GDC provides its members with the resources
            necessary to jump into Game Development.

            In the past, we have hosted guest speakers from prominent Game Designers such as the director of Doom Eternal: Hugo Martin.
